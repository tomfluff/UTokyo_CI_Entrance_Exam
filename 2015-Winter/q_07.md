## Question 7
Mod is circular. On otp of that $(x mod y) mod z = x mod min{y,z}$, and in our case:

$2^{10} < 2^{26} \rightarrow g(x) \space mod \space 2^{10} = (1103515245\cdot g(x-1) + 123245)\space  mod \space 2^{10}$

And based on that the answer for the function would be correct. Because of the concept of congruency in regards to modular operations, the answer is $k_h=2^{10}=1024$.
