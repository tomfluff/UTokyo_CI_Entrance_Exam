## Question 6
In order to achieve the needed changed we must use a listener thread which will listen to key strokes. When a key press was obtained (key+enter iin my case), the game will be updated accordingly and the board will be re-rendered.

Having one main thread for periodic printing of the board as well as a second thread that will handle key presses and will print the board accordingly based on the key press will achieve a more seamless play.

In order to achieve that we also need to make sure we handle any collisions between button press and print, and must not allow the printing to occure at the same time. So when the main thread prints the second thread needs to wait.
